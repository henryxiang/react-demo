## React Demo

The two demo apps are written with JSX and can be run directly in [JsBin](http://jsbin.com) by clicking the App links below.

To the run the apps, the following JavaScript libraries are needed:

- React 0.14.3
- Lodash 3.0.1 (only required by Todo App)

The apps are implemented with ECMAScript version 6 (ES6) so ES6/Babel needs to be selected in JsBin. Click the links below to run the apps.

1. [Counter App](http://jsbin.com/pajici/edit?html,js,output): This app simulates an group of tally counters. When the user clicks on each counter, the count number increments by 1. Right-click resets the counter to 0. Counters can also be dynamically added to UI.

2. [Todo App](http://jsbin.com/lodoru/edit?html,js,output): This is a simple ToDo app with CRUD functionality. A new todo item can be added with a input box. Clicking each todo item will toggle its status. The todo list can be filtered by clicking the buttons at the bottom. Right-clicking on each todo item removes the todo.

The [index.html](index.html) file needs to have a 'div' tag with id of 'app' for the application to mount on.
